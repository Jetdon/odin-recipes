            <h2>A delicious and creamy tomato based pasta dish</h2>

            <p>Pasta alla vodka is a dish that puts most of the emphasis on the 
                creamy and tasty tomato sauce. In my personal experience it is best
                when made with tomato paste with vodka to help keep the sauce thick
                and flavorful. Using a variety of ingredients ranging from butter,
                heavy cream, onions, and red pepper to name a few, this dish is very
                vibrant and can be adjusted to be more rich or have a bit of heat if
                you would like.
