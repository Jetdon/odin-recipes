            <h2>Delicious, dense, and sweet banana based pastry</h2>

            <p>Banana bread is one of those dishes that if you grew up pretty much
                anywhere in the US, you probably have had it I feel like. It's a small
                but dense sweet bread made with ripe or mashed bananas, sugars, butters,
                and other ingredients depending on which mother you ask about it.
                This one is a personal favorite of my family we got from online with some
                modifications.

            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Bananas, of course.I typically use 1 whole and one half overripened ones.</li>
                <li> 1/2 cup of Butter, preferably softened butter</li>
                <li>2 Eggs</li>
                <li>Brown sugar, usually 1/2 a cup to a full cup</li>
                <li>Greek yogurt, about 1/2 a cup to keep the bread moist and offset
                    the sweetness slightly.</li>
                <li>We sometimes add about 3/4 cup of chopped nuts to the recipe.</li>
                <li>A pinch of salt to enhance flavor</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Instructions</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Combine all the dry ingredients in a bowl</li>
                <li>Beat butter and brown sugar in a second bowl, then add eggs and banana</li>
                <li>Combine wet and dry mixtures</li>
                <li>Pour batter into a loaf pan and bake in a preheated oven at 350 degrees F
                    for about an hour. Check to make sure bread is ready by sticking a toothpick
                    in the center, make sure it comes out clean.</li>
            </ol>
